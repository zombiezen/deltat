Starts a new time entry.

If no arguments are given (or --continue is passed), then fzf is opened
to pick the task to associate the entry to. Ctrl-N can be pressed to
create a new task with a description from the input box.
(To use a specific fzf binary, set the DELTAT_FZF environment variable.)
If --continue-task is passed, then the task with that ID is used.
Otherwise, a new task with the given flags are used.

If --end is passed, then the entry will be ended at the given time
unless the entry is manually ended before then. --pomodoro implies an end time
of 25 minutes in the future (or whatever is set using
the pomdoro-settings command).

If --detach is passed, then the command will exit immediately
after creating the entry. Otherwise, the command will continue until
it is interrupted by Ctrl-C, SIGINT, or SIGTERM.
